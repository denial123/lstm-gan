rnn.py and gan.py contain neural networks for generating music sequences. Outputs are saved as midi files. Music21 (http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/installing/index.html) is needed to extract notes and chords from midi files.
midi_statistics.py and music_data_utils.py create gnuplot statistics in an output file. Make sure to create folder "plots" in the directory before. To plot the gnuplot and save it as a file, use http://www.gnuplot.info/
surprise.ipynb is a Jupyther Notebook to calculate Bayesian surprise on the generated sequences.
