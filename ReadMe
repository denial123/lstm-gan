# Neural Networks for Emotive Music Generation

##RNN & GAN
rnn.py and gan.py contain neural networks for generating music sequences. Outputs are saved as midi files. 
Requirements: 
+ Python 3.x
+ Music21 (http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/installing/index.html) to extract notes and chords from midi files
+ Tensorflow (use version 1.x.; I used 1.14). Create an Anaconda environment and load it into PyCharm as Python Interpreter.
+ Keras

##Getting stats
midi_statistics.py and music_data_utils.py create gnuplot statistics in an output file. 
Requirements:
+ Make sure to create folder "plots" in the directory before. 
+ Use http://www.gnuplot.info/ to plot the gnuplot as eps-file and save the plot via an online EPS-Converter of your choice.
+ python3-midi (https://github.com/louisabraham/python3-midi) is used for feature extraction

##Bayesian surprise
surprise.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook to calculate Bayesian surprise on the generated sequences. You can calculate two different suprise value, one based on two-step transitions, one based on three-step transitions. One file at a time can be evaluated. Change file="" to load new file.

## Data
anger_simple contains midi files for training with "evil" emotions
love_simple contains midi files for training with "good" emotions
