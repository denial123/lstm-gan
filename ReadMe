# Neural Networks for Emotive Music Generation

##RNN & GAN
rnn.py and gan.py contain neural networks for generating music sequences. Outputs are saved as midi files. Download Music21 (http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/installing/index.html) to extract notes and chords from midi files.

##Getting stats
midi_statistics.py and music_data_utils.py create gnuplot statistics in an output file. Make sure to create folder "plots" in the directory before. To plot the gnuplot and save it as a file, use http://www.gnuplot.info/

##Bayesian surprise
surprise.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook to calculate Bayesian surprise on the generated sequences. You can calculate two different suprise value, one based on two-step transitions, one based on three-step transitions.
